            <p>Do I need a watch to modify?</p>
            <p>Nope! We can work together to build a ground-up custom piece, or we can select an off-the-shelf watch and customize it to your liking.</p>

            <p>Can you modify an existing watch?</p>
            <p>Sure! If you have an existing watch you want modified, reach out and we can discuss options.</p>

            <p>What is the best way to contact you and get started?</p>
            <p>Please reach out via Direct Message on Instagram.</p>

            <p>Can I ship parts to you?</p>
            <p>Absolutely! You can dropship parts directly to me.</p>

            <p>Will my watch be waterproof after work has been done?</p>
            <p>No watch is truly waterproof, but rather water resistant. All watches I modify or otherwise build are pressure tested to ensure water resistance. That being said, it is the end userâ€™s responsibility to ensure proper precautions are taken prior to water exposure, such as fully tightening the crown and never submerging the watch in warm water (such as in a jacuzzi).</p>

            <p>How long with it take?</p>
            <p>Lead time varies based on my waitlist, required parts, and other factors such as shipping speed.

            In general, this varies from 7 days for builds from in-stock parts or up to 6 weeks for builds requiring more obscure parts, accounting for shipping delays.

            I always provide as accurate a lead time estimate as possible and will keep you in the loop throughout the process.</p>

            <p>Do you accept returns?</p>
            <p>No, I do not accept returns on any custom builds or modification services performed.</p>

            <p>How do I pay for your services?</p>
            <p>I accept Zelle, Cashapp, Venmo, and Paypal for modification services.</p>

            <p>Do you require a deposit?</p>
            <p>If you are commissioning a ground-up build or parts are required for your build that I do not stock, I do require a deposit with the remainder being due prior to shipment. If you want an existing watch modified, your base watch can act as a deposit.</p>
