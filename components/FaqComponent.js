    {question:"Do I need a watch to modify?", answer:"Nope! We can work together to build a ground-up custom piece, or we can select an off-the-shelf watch and customize it to your liking."},
    {question:"Can you modify an existing watch?", answer:"Sure! If you have an existing watch you want modified, reach out and we can discuss options."},
    {question:"What is the best way to contact you and get started?", answer:"Please reach out via Direct Message on Instagram."},
    {question:"Can I ship parts to you?", answer:"Absolutely! You can dropship parts directly to me."},
    {question:"Will my watch be waterproof after work has been done?", answer:"No watch is truly waterproof, but rather water resistant. All watches I modify or otherwise build are pressure tested to ensure water resistance. That being said, it is the end userâ€™s responsibility to ensure proper precautions are taken prior to water exposure, such as fully tightening the crown and never submerging the watch in warm water (such as in a jacuzzi)."},
    {question:"How long with it take?", answer:"Lead time varies based on my waitlist, required parts, and other factors such as shipping speed. In general, this varies from 7 days for builds from in-stock parts or up to 6 weeks for builds requiring more obscure parts, accounting for shipping delays. I always provide as accurate a lead time estimate as possible and will keep you in the loop throughout the process."},
    {question:"Do you accept returns?", answer:"No, I do not accept returns on any custom builds or modification services performed."},
    {question:"How do I pay for your services?", answer:"I accept Zelle, Cashapp, Venmo, and Paypal for modification services."},
    {question:"Do you require a deposit?", answer:"If you are commissioning a ground-up build or parts are required for your build that I do not stock, I do require a deposit with the remainder being due prior to shipment. If you want an existing watch modified, your base watch can act as a deposit."}
